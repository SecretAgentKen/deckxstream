## [2.0.0] - 2021-03-07

### Changed 

- BREAKING: Removed Robot.js due to building issues and having to use a random git commit instead of a proper release. Replaced it with raw `xdo` calls with a new module. This means no more Windows or Mac support. Also hotkeys will need to be modified to be X Keysym strings. For example, `Command` should now be `Super`.
